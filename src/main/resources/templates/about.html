        <div class="main-text">
            <p>Our second-grade team faced the problem of having our projects graded by our professors. 
            Grading is not always objective and it is not very convenient for the teacher to assign 
            and store grades. We decided to create our own web service offering special functionality 
            for demo projects. 
            There are 4 roles in total: 
            <ul>
                <li>second-grade</li>
                <li>fourth-grade</li>
                <li>teacher</li>
                <li>administrator</li>
            </ul>
            Everyone can grade those who are not above their grade. The teacher 
            has the ability to add a new demo. There will be an option to select a team and role. 
            Basically, it's a cool improvement to Google Forms, allowing you to see other people's grades 
            and comments and collect stats.</p>

                We managed to create registration and login, a list of existing demos. 
                For the next sprint we plan to create the ability to rate and add a comment, a nice profile, 
                statistics. A lot of work has been done, not all functionality has been added to the sprint.

                A major feature of this project has now been added: demo voting. Every student can register, 
                go to the <i>Demo</i> page, and vote for each team according to certain criteria. All scores are 
                stored in a database, and in the future it will be possible to view statistics for each team.

                A lot of work has been done on the site design: simple inscriptions in black and white have been 
                replaced by beautiful coloring in a certain color palette. The design of the voting page in the 
                demo has been updated. Also added some features: password change, re-voting.
